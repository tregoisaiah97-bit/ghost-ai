## <a name="introduction">✨ Introduction</a>

Ghost Arc is an agentic planning application built for software teams. A user submits a natural-language prompt (e.g., "Design a scalable e-commerce backend") and a Google Gemini-powered AI agent autonomously places nodes and edges onto a shared React Flow canvas in real-time. Human teammates can watch the AI build the diagram live, then jump in to collaboratively refine it. Once the team is satisfied, a second AI background task converts the visual graph into a comprehensive, multi-page Markdown technical specification that can be downloaded directly from the app.

## <a name="tech-stack">⚙️ Tech Stack</a>

- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)** is a production-ready React framework that offers server-side rendering, static site generation, and powerful routing features. It streamlines the development of full-stack web applications by providing a comprehensive ecosystem for performance optimization, data fetching, and API development.

- **[React](https://react.dev/)** is a popular JavaScript library for building declarative and component-based user interfaces. It excels at creating reusable UI components and efficient state management, making it the standard choice for building dynamic and interactive single-page applications.

- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript that adds static type definitions to your code. It significantly improves developer productivity and code reliability by catching errors during development, enhancing IDE support, and facilitating maintainability in large-scale projects.

- **[Liveblocks](https://jsm.dev/ghost-liveblocks)** is a real-time collaboration infrastructure that enables developers to build multiplayer experiences. It provides robust APIs for presence, shared state, and text synchronization, allowing you to easily add collaborative features like cursors, whiteboard tools, and shared document editing to your apps.

- **[Clerk](https://jsm.dev/ghost-clerk)** is a specialized authentication and user management platform for React and Next.js. It offers drop-in pre-built components for sign-in, sign-up, and profile management, while handling complex requirements like session management, multi-factor authentication, and organization hierarchies out of the box.

- **[Trigger.dev](https://jsm.dev/ghost-triggerdev)** is an open-source platform for orchestrating long-running background jobs and workflows. It allows developers to define jobs directly in their code that respond to webhooks, schedules, or events, handling retries, delays, and state management without the need for complex infrastructure.

- **[Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/)** is a next-generation ORM for Node.js and TypeScript that simplifies database interactions. By providing a type-safe client generated from your schema, it makes querying your database intuitive, readable, and highly efficient, effectively eliminating common SQL-related runtime errors.

- **[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)** is an advanced, open-source object-relational database system widely recognized for its reliability, extensibility, and standard compliance. It provides the persistent storage layer for your application, supporting complex queries, transactional integrity, and large-scale data handling.

- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** is a utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid custom UI development. By utilizing low-level utility classes directly in your markup, it removes the need to switch between CSS and HTML files, allowing for highly consistent and responsive design systems.

- **[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)** is a collection of beautifully designed, accessible, and re-usable UI components that you can copy and paste directly into your projects. Built on top of Radix UI and Tailwind CSS, it grants you full control over your component code, avoiding the bloat of traditional component libraries.

- **[CodeRabbit](https://jsm.dev/ghost-coderabbit)** is an AI-powered code review assistant that automates pull request analysis. It provides line-by-line feedback, suggests code improvements, summarizes changes, and helps maintain high code quality by integrating seamlessly into your git-based development workflow.

## <a name="features">🔋 Features</a>

👉 **AI Architecture Agent**: Submit a plain-English prompt; Gemini draws nodes and edges onto the live canvas in real-time via Trigger.dev background tasks and the Liveblocks Node.js SDK.

👉 **Multiplayer Canvas**: Full real-time collaboration powered by Liveblocks: synchronized node/edge state, live cursor positions, and presence avatars for every connected user.

👉 **Custom Canvas Nodes**: Double-click to edit node labels inline; select to resize with NodeResizer; choose from 12 colour swatches via a floating NodeToolbar — all synced across clients instantly.

👉 **AI Spec Generation**: One click converts the current graph into a detailed Markdown technical specification using a second Gemini-powered Trigger.dev task.

👉 **Multi-Spec Storage**: Each project stores multiple specs. Metadata lives in PostgreSQL (Prisma); content is stored as Markdown files on disk (`data/specs/{projectId}/{specId}.md`).

👉 **Downloadable Specs**: Every generated spec is available via a dedicated download API route.

👉 **Clerk Authentication**: Global route protection via `clerkMiddleware`; Liveblocks tokens are only issued to authenticated users.

👉 **Auto-Save Canvas**: The canvas state is debounced-saved to `data/canvas/{projectId}.json` every 3 seconds of inactivity.

👉 **Project Management**: Create projects from a slide-in sidebar; project slugs auto-generate room IDs; the active room is highlighted.

👉 **Share**: One-click URL copy with a 1.5 s "Copied" confirmation.

And many more, including code architecture and reusability.

## <a name="quick-start">🤸 Quick Start</a>

Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your machine.

**Prerequisites**

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

**Cloning the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adrianhajdin/ghost-ai.git
cd ghost-ai
```

**Installation**

Install the project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

**Set Up Environment Variables**

Create a new file named `.env` in the root of your project and add the following content:

```env
# Clerk
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up

LIVEBLOCKS_SECRET_KEY=

TRIGGER_SECRET_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_TRIGGER_PUBLIC_API_KEY=

DATABASE_URL=

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
# Ubuntu 
Ubuntu_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=
# Optional: override the default Gemini model (default: gemini-2.0-flash)
GEMINI_MODEL=
# Optional: override model used specifically for spec generation
GEMINI_SPEC_MODEL=

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Replace the placeholder values with your real credentials. You can get these by signing up at: [**Clerk**](https://jsm.dev/ghost-clerk), [**Liveblocks**](https://jsm.dev/ghost-liveblocks), [**Trigger.dev**](https://jsm.dev/ghost-triggerdev), [**Ubuntu Studio**](https://Ubuntu/).

**Running the Project**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the project.

**Run Trigger.dev (Background Tasks)**

In a second terminal, start the Trigger.dev dev worker so background AI tasks execute locally:

```bash
npx trigger.dev@latest dev
```
